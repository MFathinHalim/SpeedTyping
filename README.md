# 🌸 Paperline team: (still working for project title)
## A heartfelt story about finding freedom, friendship, and identity beyond expectations.

## 🧵 Synopsis
You play as a boy born into a wealthy family — the son of a world-famous fashion designer.
After your mother’s passing, your life has been nothing but rules, schedules, and the spotlight.
You’ve never gone to a normal school, never had real friends — until now.

At 15, after a heated argument with your father, you finally earn permission to attend a public high school.
But there’s a catch — you must still obey all his wishes and maintain your image as a “perfect model.”

At first, school life feels strange and distant. Yet slowly, you begin to feel warmth you’ve never known before:
laughter, friendship, and a girl named Mahiru, who sees you for who you truly are — not the designer’s son, but you.
